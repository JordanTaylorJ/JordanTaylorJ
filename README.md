### Hi there 👋 I'm Jordan!

Current student in a full stack software engineering program.

I am experienced 💫 working with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Python, Ruby and SQL. I'm currently 🔭 learning about Rails. I look forward to 🌱 learning Redux.

I also have a bachelors in accounting 🧮 and marketing 📈 from Colorado State University 💙 and a fixed-wing private pilot license ✈️. 

When I'm not coding, I'm 🏔 outdoors 🏔 - 🏂 🚵‍♀️ 🛹 - 

⚡ Fun Facts: I also paint 🎨 and have played eight instruments throughout my life 🎷 🎸 🎻 🎼 . 


Happy to have you here,
